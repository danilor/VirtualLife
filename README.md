# VirtualLife

This is an experimental project. It is being built using Unity Technology and C# (Visual Studio Express Edition). Don't rely on this project since its in a very early state (we can say its a just born baby) and it needs a lot of work to be complete. 

If you are going to use anything of this code (clases, sprites or examples) you agree that they may not work as intented and may cause troubles.

## TODO List

- [X] Basic structure
- [X] Basic life class
- [ ] Move the JAVA Generator Map from this repository to C#
- [ ] Random generation of animals
- [ ] Add visual to the code using Unity (turn object instances into MonoBehavior objects)
- [ ] A lot more
